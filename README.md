<h1 align = 'center'>Vanilla Notes (Abandoned)</h1> 
<p align = 'center'>
Vanilla Notes is a free, open source android application that lets users take notes. The focus is to have a clean, simple, yet functional interface while still having the essentials. It is fully offline, doesn't use unnecessary permissions, and does not save your notes to anywhere other than on your device.
